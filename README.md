# Face-mask-detection-project
Face Mask Detector with Python. 

Technology :- Machine Learning

Modules used :- Keras
                OpenCv
                Tensorflow
                and others.
The face mask recognition in this project is developed by using a machine learning that will be using the image classification method: MobileNetV2.
We will built a model. 
The built model can detect whether people are wearing a face mask or not. \
It will also ring an alarm whenever person is not wearing a mask.
